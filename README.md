# PigLatinator

This program is written as a response to the following prompt, which I found at http://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html:

Write function that translated a text to Pig Latin and back. English is translated to Pig Latin by taking the first letter of every word, moving it to the end of the word and adding ‘ay’. “The quick brown fox” becomes “Hetay uickqay rownbay oxfay”.
